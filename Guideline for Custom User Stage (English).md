Custom map files exist in the ```Custom Map Files``` folder in the location of your game's executable.

When you create a custom map, a folder named ```custom_map_file_(creation date)```<b>with the number </b> is created.

*You can rename the custom map folder to anything you want. <b>(you must be out of the game to do so)</b>

<summary>Custom Bullet Image <b>[Click]</b></summary>

<div align = "center">

Navigate to the folder where the files for the map you want to add a custom ammo image to exist.

Inside the ```custom_hitbox_image``` folder, go to either the ```center_origin``` or ```top_origin``` folder.

[The difference between ```center_origin``` and ```top_origin``` is that the position of the center axis when rotating the image is different]

= Most bullets use ```center_origin```, so you can put the image inside that folder.

</br></br>


<img src = "imgs\Guideline_imgs\gl7.PNG" width = "480px">

#### - Caution! -

Images must have a ```.png``` extension <b>(*Image file name can be anything)</b>.

Images must be composed of only ```perfect white``` colors to be able to be colored in-game.

The background of the image must be transparent.

We recommend an image size of 512x512 <b>(*possible error)</b>.
